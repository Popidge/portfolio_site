I am in need of an impactful, informative and engaging portfolio for my hobbyist+freelance AI/web development work.
The portfolio should capture my history, passions, interests and personality.

I'm Jamie Taylor, a Hobbyist AI and Web Dev Engineer from Loughborough, UK. I am an AI-native, always finding new fun way to use AI to complete tasks, build amazing projects and push the boundaries. I've worked in a variety of fields - from UK Civil Service Middle-Management, BBC Local Radio, VR Experience Operations, IT Support and I have a degree in Chemistry (University of Leicester, BSc Hons, 2012). 

Your task is to build this site, making it visually unique, striking, memorable and impactful, whilst clearly communicating me and my history. 

The site will be built using Astro for static-site generation. I have scaffolded the project (using pnpm create astro@latest), and added Tailwind v4. Use the astro-framework and tailwind-design-system skills to  do this properly.

The key information will be my portfolio projects. Create a unified component for these that takes data from a markdown file for each project and presents it on the site.

Be creative in making the site - use the frontend-design skill. Push your creative limits. Create five different designs (accessible at /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5), each with thier own unique design style.

If you are creating any reactive components using astro's islands, use React (with the react skill) - you don't have to, though.
