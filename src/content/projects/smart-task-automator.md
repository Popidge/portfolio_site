## Overview

Born from my experience in UK Civil Service middle-management, where I witnessed countless hours lost to repetitive administrative tasks, this Smart Task Automator brings AI-powered intelligence to workflow automation.

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Task Definition**: Describe what you want automated in plain English
- **Intelligent Routing**: AI determines optimal execution paths based on task complexity
- **Self-Healing Workflows**: Automatic error recovery and adaptive retry strategies
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability for compliance requirements
- **Integration Hub**: Connects with popular services (Slack, Notion, Google Workspace, etc.)

### Technical Highlights

Built on Temporal for durable workflow execution, ensuring tasks complete reliably even through system restarts. Claude API integration enables sophisticated task understanding and decomposition.

### Real-World Impact

In testing with former colleagues, the automator reduced monthly reporting time from 8 hours to 45 minutes - a 90% time saving that freed people for more meaningful work.

### Lessons from the Civil Service

My management experience taught me that the best automation doesn't replace human judgment - it enhances it by removing the tedious parts and letting people focus on decisions that matter.
