## Overview

Drawing from my VR Experience Operations background, this project democratizes museum access. Whether you're in Loughborough or Lagos, you can explore world-class exhibits in immersive 3D.

### Key Features

- **Photorealistic Environments**: High-fidelity recreations of museum spaces
- **Interactive Exhibits**: Touch, rotate, and examine artifacts up close
- **Guided Audio Tours**: AI-narrated explanations adapting to user interest
- **Accessibility Options**: Seated mode, teleportation, and comfort settings
- **Social Features**: Explore with friends in shared virtual spaces

### Technical Highlights

Built in Unity with cross-platform support for Oculus Quest and WebXR, ensuring both dedicated VR users and browser visitors can participate. Blender workflows enable efficient 3D asset creation.

### Operations Experience Applied

Running VR experiences taught me what works: intuitive controls, comfortable locomotion, clear visual guidance. Every design decision in this project reflects real observations of how people interact with VR.

### Educational Impact

Museums are knowledge repositories, but geography limits access. This project aims to remove that barrier, letting a student in rural UK have the same access as someone in London.

### Future Vision

Current work focuses on AI-generated exhibit descriptions that adapt to viewer age and expertise level, making the same artifact engaging for both children and scholars.
