## Overview

Idle Vibe Code Quest transforms the modern software development experience into an addictive incremental game. Players start with nothing but a keyboard and AI assistance, clicking to generate lines of code while shipping projects to earn money and credibility. The game satirizes startup culture through mechanics like accumulating tech debt that slows progress, hiring increasingly expensive help, and prestige resetting when players hit walls.

The game demonstrates Svelte 5's new runes API for reactive state management, with a fully responsive mobile-first design and both dark and light themes. It's positioned as a meme game where TypeScript safety meets degenerate clicker mechanics, complete with offline gains so players can return later to accumulated progress.

### Key Features

- Click-based line generation with upgrades for more code per click (Vibe Code, Delegation, Tech Tree)
- Project shipping system earning money and cred with new projects unlocking as credibility grows
- Tech debt accumulation mechanic that actively slows progress as the player scales
- Prestige system with permanent meta-upgrades when hitting walls
- Offline progress gains when returning after time away
- Random events bringing chaos to the startup experience
- Dark/light themes and full mobile responsiveness

### Technical Highlights

Built on Svelte 5 with runes for state management, the project uses TypeScript throughout with proper type safety. Vite provides speedy builds, and pnpm handles package management efficiently. The architecture separates concerns between game logic, stores, and components.

### Origin Story

The creator wanted to capture the absurdity of modern "vibe coding" culture—shipping products with AI assistance while pretending everything is fine—into a game format. The satirical elements directly mock startup culture tropes.
