## Overview

Combining my chemistry background's love for data with modern web development, this dashboard makes complex information accessible and beautiful. Because data should tell stories, not hide them.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket connections deliver live data without page refreshes
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Automatic detection of anomalies, trends, and correlations
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click, zoom, and drill down into any data point
- **Custom Visualizations**: From traditional charts to novel data representations
- **Export & Share**: Generate reports and shareable snapshots

### Technical Highlights

The frontend leverages D3.js for custom visualizations, with React handling state management and component composition. A Python backend processes large datasets efficiently using Pandas and NumPy.

### Chemistry Meets Code

My BSc in Chemistry from Leicester taught me to see patterns in complex data. This dashboard applies that same analytical thinking to modern datasets, whether they're tracking web metrics or scientific measurements.

### Design Philosophy

Every visualization decision prioritizes clarity. Colors are chosen for accessibility, animations guide attention without distraction, and layouts adapt to screen size without losing information hierarchy.
